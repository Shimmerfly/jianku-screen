// The editing sidecar: everything the editor changed about a recording, kept in a file
// next to the recording instead of inside it.
//
// Why a sidecar rather than editing `project.json`:
//   - `project.json` is the *recorder's* manifest. It is rewritten while a recording
//     is finalising (`state`: preparing → recording → processing → readyForProcessing),
//     so an editor writing it at the same time is a real corruption race, not a
//     theoretical one.
//   - the recorder may clean up files it does not recognise in the project directory;
//     keeping the edit in a file with its own name means that question has to be
//     answered explicitly rather than by accident.
//   - "editing never modifies the recording or its manifest" is a property worth being
//     able to state, and this is what makes it true.
//
// The file is `edit.json` inside the project directory, written atomically (a
// half-written file would make a project unopenable, which is worse than losing the
// edit).
