// One recording, open for editing: the top-level object a tab is a view of.
//
// Why this type has to exist: `TimelineController` and `ExportController` used to be
// process-wide singletons in `main.cpp`, wired to "the recording that finished last".
// That is fine for one editor and impossible for two. Two tabs sharing one controller
// means undo in one tab changes the other, and — worse — `TimelineController::load()`
// resets the timeline, so merely switching tabs would discard the edit you were not
// looking at. Two tabs sharing one exporter means the export targets whichever project
// was opened most recently, which is not necessarily the one on screen.
//
// So the state moves here, one instance per project, and the window layer just decides
// which session is visible. The session deliberately does *not* know about windows: a
// tab that is dragged into a new window keeps the same session, and a window that
// closes while its session is still open elsewhere must not take the session with it.

    //
    // They must be Q_PROPERTYs, not plain accessors. A plain method is invisible to the
    // engine, so `session.timeline` evaluated to `undefined` and every binding through
    // it failed with "Cannot read property of undefined" — a wall of errors that named
    // the strip rather than the missing property.
