// The previous attempt at this was a real-time GLSL path that flickered while
// zooming and tore while panning, and it was reverted. The failure mode was
// temporal, not per-frame: each frame looked plausible on its own. So these checks
// are mostly about what happens *across* frames — that the channel choice does not
// oscillate, that sampling is deterministic, and that the amount of smear moves
// continuously rather than snapping between two states.
//
// The parameter rules being pinned here come from the static research on the
// reference's renderer (research/桌面动画处理链-官方3.7.5静态.md §6).
